Project Overview
This project addresses the limitations of traditional reactive monitoring systems by combining real-time metric collection with predictive analytics. It uses:

Prometheus to scrape and store system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network, etc.).

Exporters (Node Exporter, Windows Exporter, or custom exporters) to gather hardware/software data.

Machine Learning Models to predict downtime based on historical trends and anomalies.

Grafana for interactive dashboards and Alertmanager for proactive notifications.

Architecture
System Architecture

Data Collection Layer:

Exporters: Collect metrics from servers (e.g., Node Exporter for Linux, Windows Exporter for Windows).

Custom Exporters: Monitor hardware-specific metrics (temperature, fan speed) via tools like IPMIUtil or Open Hardware Monitor.

Storage and Processing Layer:

Prometheus: Scrapes and stores time-series data.

Alertmanager: Handles alert routing and notifications.

Analytics Layer:

Machine Learning Model: Analyzes metrics to predict downtime (e.g., LSTM, Random Forest).

Visualization Layer:

Grafana: Displays real-time dashboards and predictive insights.

Key Features
Real-Time Monitoring:

Track CPU, memory, disk I/O, network traffic, and custom hardware metrics.

Supports cross-platform monitoring (Linux, Windows, hybrid environments).

Predictive Analytics:

Forecast server downtime using anomaly detection and time-series forecasting.

Train models on historical data to identify failure patterns.

Proactive Alerts:

Trigger notifications via Slack, Email, or PagerDuty before critical failures occur.

Customize alert thresholds based on ML predictions.

Scalable and Modular:

Add new exporters or metrics without disrupting existing workflows.

Deploy in cloud, on-premises, or hybrid environments.

Installation Guide
Prerequisites
Prometheus: Download

Node Exporter (Linux): GitHub

Windows Exporter: GitHub

Grafana: Installation Guide

Python 3.8+: For ML model training and inference.

Steps
Install Prometheus:

Follow the official Prometheus installation guide.

Deploy Exporters:

For Linux: Install Node Exporter to collect system metrics.

For Windows: Use Windows Exporter for CPU, memory, and disk monitoring.

Set Up Alertmanager:

Configure notification channels (e.g., Slack, Email) using the Alertmanager docs.

Install Grafana:

Connect Grafana to Prometheus as a data source.

Custom Exporters
Use tools like IPMIUtil to collect hardware metrics (temperature, fan speed) and expose them via a custom endpoint.

Machine Learning Integration
Workflow
Data Collection:

Export historical metrics from Prometheus using its HTTP API.

Preprocessing:

Clean and normalize data (e.g., handle missing values, scale features).

Model Training:

Train models like LSTM (for time-series data) or Gradient Boosting (for tabular data).

Deployment:

Deploy the model as a microservice to generate real-time predictions.

Feedback Loop:

Continuously update the model with new data to improve accuracy.

Tools and Libraries
Python Libraries: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas.

Data Storage: InfluxDB, Prometheus.

Model Serving: Flask, FastAPI, or TensorFlow Serving.

Visualization and Alerts
Grafana Dashboards
Import pre-built dashboards for system metrics:

Node Exporter Dashboard

Windows Exporter Dashboard

Create custom dashboards to visualize ML predictions (e.g., downtime risk scores).

Alerting Scenarios
High CPU Usage: Trigger alerts when CPU usage exceeds 90% for 5 minutes.

Predicted Downtime: Notify teams when the ML model predicts a >80% risk of downtime.

Use Cases
Data Centers: Prevent unplanned outages in server clusters.

Cloud Infrastructure: Monitor AWS EC2, Azure VMs, or Google Cloud instances.

IoT Edge Devices: Predict failures in distributed IoT systems.

Enterprise IT: Ensure uptime for critical business applications.

Troubleshooting
Issue	Solution
Exporters not detected	Verify firewall rules for Prometheus ports (9090/9100/9182).
Missing hardware metrics	Install IPMI drivers or use third-party tools like Open Hardware Monitor.
Alerts not triggering	Check Alertmanager logs and configuration syntax.
Grafana dashboard errors	Validate Prometheus queries and data source permissions.
