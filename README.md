Real-time Server Downtime Prediction and Monitoring
    
Welcome to the Real-time Server Downtime Prediction and Monitoring project! This repository houses a machine learning (ML) system designed to predict server failures before they occur, enabling proactive maintenance to ensure uninterrupted IT operations. By combining advanced ML models like Random Forest (99.98% accuracy) with real-time monitoring tools Prometheus and Grafana, our solution empowers IT teams to detect anomalies and act swiftly, reducing downtime and costs.
Project Overview
Modern IT infrastructure demands reliability, but unexpected server downtime can disrupt operations and incur significant losses. Our project addresses this challenge by:

Predicting Downtime: Using ML models trained on a synthetic dataset with metrics like CPU usage, disk I/O, and network traffic.
Real-time Monitoring: Integrating Prometheus for continuous data collection and Grafana for intuitive dashboards and alerts.
Proactive Maintenance: Enabling IT teams to intervene before failures, unlike traditional reactive systems.

Key features:

Random Forest model with 99.98% cross-validation accuracy, outperforming XGBoost (99.95%), SVM (99.15%), KNN (97.56%), and Neural Networks (97.68%).
Real-time predictions delivered every 30 seconds via a Flask API.
Multi-cloud compatibility through a diverse synthetic dataset simulating AWS, Azure, and on-premises environments.
User-friendly Grafana visualizations for server health and downtime probabilities.

Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally. Prerequisites include Python 3.8+, Docker (for Prometheus/Grafana), and Git.
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/server-downtime-prediction.git
cd server-downtime-prediction

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Key dependencies: scikit-learn, xgboost, flask, prometheus-client, pandas, numpy.
4. Configure Prometheus and Grafana

Prometheus:

Pull the Prometheus Docker image:docker pull prom/prometheus:v2.45.0


Update prometheus.yml in the config/ directory with your server metrics endpoints.
Run Prometheus:docker run -p 9090:9090 -v $(pwd)/config/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus

Grafana:

Pull the Grafana Docker image:docker pull grafana/grafana:10.0.0


Run Grafana:docker run -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana


Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000 (default login: admin/admin).
Add Prometheus as a data source and import dashboards from grafana/dashboards/.


5. Prepare the Dataset

The synthetic dataset is in data/synthetic_server_data.csv.
Preprocess the data using:python scripts/preprocess_data.py

This handles missing values, scales features, and splits data (80-20 train-test).

Usage

Train the ML Models:

Train Random Forest, XGBoost, and other models:python scripts/train_models.py


Models are saved in models/ (e.g., random_forest_model.pkl).


Run the Flask API:

Start the prediction API:python api/app.py


The API runs at http://localhost:5000/predict, accepting server metrics and returning downtime probabilities.


Monitor with Prometheus and Grafana:

Ensure Prometheus is scraping metrics from the Flask API (configured in prometheus.yml).
Access Grafana dashboards to visualize CPU usage, disk I/O, and predicted downtime risks.
Set up alerts in Grafana for probabilities above 0.75.



Example API request:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"cpu_usage": 85, "memory_usage": 70, "disk_io": 500, "network_traffic": 200}'

Response:
{"downtime_probability": 0.92, "status": "Warning: High risk"}

Results
Our evaluation shows Random Forest as the top performer, achieving 99.98% accuracy on a synthetic dataset with balanced failure and non-failure cases. Key metrics:

Random Forest: 99.98% accuracy
XGBoost: 99.95% accuracy
SVM: 99.15% accuracy
KNN: 97.56% accuracy
Neural Networks: 97.68% accuracy

Grafana dashboards provide real-time insights, reducing response times compared to traditional systems.
Future Enhancements

Validate models with real-world server logs from AWS, Azure, and on-premises setups.
Integrate unsupervised anomaly detection (e.g., Auto-Encoders, Isolation Forests) for rare failures.
Predict downtime duration alongside occurrence for better recovery planning.
Optimize Flask API for high-frequency workloads in large-scale environments.
